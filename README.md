# iOS London Meet-up
## Hackathon, April 2019

Here is our iOS app, created using Apple's Core ML and Vision libraries.
As we only had three hours for this work, it's based heavily on Apple's FlowerShop sample app.

The aim of the app was to classify fruit using Vision and then display some relevant nutrional information.

Included in the repository is our short PowerPoint presentation we made as part of our pitch and demo.

The Team consisted of:
